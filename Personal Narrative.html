<h1>Personal Narrative</h1>
<p> My name is Alanna Salce, and I am currently a junior enrolled at George Mason 
University pursing a Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science with a concentration in 
Intelligence Studies and a minor in Digital Media and Wed Design.</p>
<p>I am very well versed in a multitude of skills and experiences. As a lead camp 
counselor, Iâ€™ve learned how to communicate effectively with others and adapt quickly when 
put in high demanding situations. My ability to multitask and stay organized was further 
developed through my previous role in customer service and my current role as a Billing 
Clerk at Berenzweig Leonard, LLP, where I not only deal with the finances and transactions
coming in and out of our accounting platforms, but also where I manage filing systems, 
take detailed notes regarding cases and in trainings, and handle sensitive information 
with discretion.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am a certified notary, and hold a Logikull certification, which is 
an eDiscovery platform used at my current job, and I am currently working toward my 
Microsoft Office Specialist certification. These tools not only enhance my technology 
proficiency but also provide support to my long-term goal of becoming a criminal 
investigator with the FBI.</p>
<p>I am particularly drawn to internships offering the opportunity to gain hands-on 
investigative experience, strengthen my critical thinking and communication skills, 
and expand my professional network. Also, I am eager to learn from experienced 
professionals and contribute in a meaningful way to the teams I become a part of.</p>
