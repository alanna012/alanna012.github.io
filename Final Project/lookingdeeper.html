<h1>Looking Deeper Into The Artist</h1>
<p> When I was a child, I was obsessed with all things art. I loved to paint, sketch, color, do photography, anything that consisted of creativity and color I would participate in.
My passion only grew more as I got older. Creating new pieces became the highlight of my day and I often found myself sitting in my room for hours engrossed in my creation.
The more I created, the more I wanted to keep going and trying new things. I discovered digital art and I grew obsessed with it. I would draw cartoon characters, cartoon versions of photos I took, the digital versions of my own hand drawn pieces,
and so much more. I went to design posters for family members and now tattoo designs for myself.</p>

<p>Art is my way to show who I am and is my way of expressing myself when I can't find the words to state how I'm feeling. 
This is my escape from reality and going through my work you will get a glimpse of who I am. I hope that you can take away something, anything, when taking a look at my pieces.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming along with me in my creative journey!</p>

<p>with love and kindess,</p>
<p>Alanna</p>
