	<h1>Personal Narrative</h1>
	<p> My name is Alanna Salce, and I am currently a junior enrolled at George Mason 
	University pursing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Forensic Science with a concentration in 
	Intelligence Studies and a minor in Digital Media and Wed Design.</strong></p>
	<p>I am very well versed in a multitude of skills and experiences. As a lead camp 
	counselor, Iâ€™ve learned how to communicate <em>effectively</em> with others and adapt quickly when 
	put in high demanding situations. My ability to <b>multitask and stay organized</b> was further 
	developed through my previous role in customer service and my <strong>current</strong> role as a Billing 
	Clerk at <a href="https://www.berenzweiglaw.com/">Berenzweig Leonard, LLP</a>, where I not only deal with the finances and transactions
	coming in and out of our accounting platforms, but also where I manage filing systems, 
	take detailed notes regarding cases and in trainings, and handle <em>sensitive</em> information 
	with discretion.</p>
	<section>
	<p>Additionally, I am a <b>certified notary</b>, and hold a <b>Logikull certification</b>, which is 
	an eDiscovery platform used at my current job, and I am currently working toward my 
	<strong>Microsoft Office Specialist certification</strong>. These tools not only enhance my technology 
	proficiency but also provide support to my long-term goal of becoming a criminal 
	investigator with the FBI.</p>
	</section>
	<p>I am particularly drawn to internships offering the opportunity to gain hands-on 
	investigative experience, strengthen my critical thinking and communication skills, 
	and expand my professional network. Also, I am eager to learn from experienced 
	professionals and contribute in a meaningful way to the teams I become a part of.</p>
