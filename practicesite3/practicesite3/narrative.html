								<h3>Who I Am!</h3>
								<p>Hi! My name is Alanna Salce. I am from Virginia, but I was born in Manhattan, New York. I am a junior at George Mason University studying Forensic Science with a concentration in Intelligence Studies and a minor in Digital Media and Web Design. </p>

								<p>I am very passionate about the criminal justice system and I am looking to gain a future career as a Criminal Investigator with the FBI. I also enjoy marketing because of some classes I took in High School and decided it would be a good minor to have especially with the usage of computers now a days.</p>

								<h4>My Hobbies and My Goals</h4>
								<p>When it comes to discussing things I enjoy, take a seat because there is a long list of things I enjoy. Starting off with reading. I absolutely love to read. It is one of my favorite things ever. Sitting down and getting lost in a fictional novel is the way I like to spend my rainy days. Next is going to the gym. The gym is a very nice stress reliever for me and I also feel that it is helping me prepare for future training for the FBI. I also love listening to music, anything but country, although country music is growing on me, so basically I will listen to anything. I have a shopping addiction. Whether it is buying clothes or things for my room, I am a shopaholic. I like hanging out with my family and friends, playing with my dogs, taking walks, and a whole bunch of other stuff I can't name right now because if I do we will be here forever.

								<p>This is just a glimpse into who I am. To learn more about me and my energetic, organized, loud, creative, and overall bubbly personality just click through to read more about me, my experiences and skills, as well as my college education so far. Welcome to Alanna's world!</p>
